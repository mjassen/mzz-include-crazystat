== Installation ==
0. Install the CrazyStat software on your website. This plugin doesn't do that. This plugin just "points to"/includes the CrazyStat installation.
1. Put the mzz-include-crazystat.php file into a folder mzz-include-crazystat and upload the folder to the plugins directory in your WordPress installation.
2. From the WordPress dashboard, activate the plugin.
That's it! Now whenever someone visits your site the include code fires and so it allows the CrazyStat installation to start gathering statistics.
